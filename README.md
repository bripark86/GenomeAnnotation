# GenomeAnnotation

### Purpose

This repository contains various scripts that I have created that are useful for genome annotation (repeats & proteins). They may exist in some form already elsewhere, but they are here in case others need them. In particular, they are used in a MAKER tutorial I created, which I have heard others reference a lot.

### Brief Descriptions

I try to provide more details and usage information at the beginning of each script. Here is a quick description of what each script does for reference.
